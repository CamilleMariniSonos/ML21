### Settings

The following environment variables need to be set:  
* `LK_DATABASE_NAME`: name of the postgreSQL database  
* `LK_DATABASE_USER`: user of the postgreSQL database  
* `LK_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: password of the postgreSQL database  

### Current state of the project

* draft of a django project     
* draft of a database structure (in PostGre)  

### Todo

Some ideas:  
- [ ] discuss and design database structure  
- [ ] command to upload data, and associated view and template  
- [ ] view and template to define a problem associated with the dataset (classification, regression, or clustering)    
- [ ] command to apply all existing scikit learn estimators to solve the problem  
- [ ] view and template to compare the results of the different estimators (and details for each estimators: best parameters)
